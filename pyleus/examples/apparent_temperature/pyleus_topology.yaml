# This topology will compute every 2 seconds the wind chill factor and the heat
# index for the locations monitored by wheater stations sending their sensors
# data through 3 different streams: one for the temperature, one for the wind
# speed and one for the relative humidity. This topology serve the purpose to
# demonstrate how to join between realtime streams. It is also worth to note
# that this topology presents two different "final-stage" bolts.
