# Topology built to demonstrate how to handle multiple output streams.
# The aim of this simple topology is to compute the total earning coming
# from in-app microtransactions of our MobilePyleus app.
# However, since we also launched in UK and in Italy, some transactions are
# expressed in foreign currency. Other than the total earnings, we would like
# to compute the earnings for each currency once exchanged in dollars.
# Exchange rates are also represented as a real-time data flow.
# Parallelism and optimizations have been put aside for sake of clarity.
